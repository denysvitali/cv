I am a competent IT professional and perfectionist who likes to work with Open Source technologies.
I love to solve problems with my expertise and know-how, always putting the maximum effort in what I do.
I am always open to learning new things to improve my skill-set.\\

I currently live in Zurich, Switzerland and I'm still learning German - I recently moved here to 
improve my IT expertise and language speaking capabilities.
